# Internship-SurveyChatBot
For my internship project, I built a full stack project from scratch. The end goals for this project were to be able to:
- From an admin interface, build sequential surveys with yes/no questions, combination questions, text questions, conditional questions...
- The admin interface handles everything from adding participants, mailing participants, creating email templates, creating the survey itself etc.
- Send invitations through email to potential participants
- Have the participants fill in the survey through a chatbot experience.
